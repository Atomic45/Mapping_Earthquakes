# Mapping_Earthquakes Summary

The Mapping Earthquake analysis involved creating interactive maps by pulling data with API keys, and the USGS website. The tools used were JavaScript, Leaflet library, d3.js, GeoJSON, and HTML. With these tools and resources, the maps created included: 

- different map styles like streets, dark, and satellite maps. 
- plotting the maps for specific locations using points, lines and polygons. 
- adding popup boxes to display data and location information.
- and different styles from css such as color, size, and markers. 

To take it a step further, additional items were included, such as earthquake data. This involved adding the magnitude of the earthquakes within the last 7 days, and then adding them to the maps. Layers were added to allow the user to interact with the maps by selecting the type of map, tectonic plates, and earthquake magnitude. 

All of the maps were merged by using GitHub to create branches from the main branch. These branches are used to allow other team members to add comments or suggestions for input on the analysis.
